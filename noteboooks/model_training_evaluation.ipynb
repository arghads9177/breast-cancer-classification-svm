    "# Breast Cancer Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project involves building a classification model to predict whether a breast cancer tumor is benign or malignant based on features extracted from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The dataset contains real-valued features that describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The classification task involves predicting the diagnosis (benign or malignant) using these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this project is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**, which is publicly available on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29). The project involves data preprocessing, feature analysis, and building a machine learning model to accurately classify the tumors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is freely available in Kaggele in the following link:\n",
    "> [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data/data]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ID number**: Unique identifier for each sample.\n",
    "2. **Diagnosis**: Target variable (M = malignant, B = benign).\n",
    "3. **Features**: There are 30 real-valued features computed for each cell nucleus in the image. These features include:\n",
    "   - **Radius** (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)\n",
    "   - **Texture** (standard deviation of gray-scale values)\n",
    "   - **Perimeter**\n",
    "   - **Area**\n",
    "   - **Smoothness** (local variation in radius lengths)\n",
    "   - **Compactness** (perimeter² / area - 1.0)\n",
    "   - **Concavity** (severity of concave portions of the contour)\n",
    "   - **Concave points** (number of concave portions of the contour)\n",
    "   - **Symmetry**\n",
    "   - **Fractal dimension** (\"coastline approximation\" - 1)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The mean, standard error, and \"worst\" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in a total of 30 features. For instance:\n",
    "   - Field 3 is Mean Radius.\n",
    "   - Field 13 is Radius Standard Error (SE).\n",
    "   - Field 23 is Worst Radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number of Instances**: 569\n",
    "- **Number of Attributes**: 32 (ID number, diagnosis, and 30 real-valued features)\n",
    "- **Missing Values**: None\n",
    "- **Class Distribution**: 357 benign, 212 malignant\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attribute Information\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ID number**\n",
    "2. **Diagnosis**: (M = malignant, B = benign)\n",
    "3. **Ten real-valued features** are computed for each cell nucleus:\n",
    "   - **Radius** (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)\n",
    "   - **Texture** (standard deviation of gray-scale values)\n",
    "   - **Perimeter**: Perimeter of the tumor.\n",
    "   - **Area**: Area of the tumor.\n",
    "   - **Smoothness** (local variation in radius lengths)\n",
    "   - **Compactness** (perimeter² / area - 1.0)\n",
    "   - **Concavity** (severity of concave portions of the contour)\n",
    "   - **Concave points** (number of concave portions of the contour)\n",
    "   - **Symmetry**\n",
    "   - **Fractal dimension** (\"coastline approximation\" - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Training**: Train the model with the cleaned data to classify a tumor wheather it is malignant or benign.\n",
    "- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using different evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score.\n"

    "### Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation metrics for the SVM classifier on the Breast Cancer classification task show good overall performance, especially in terms of generalization to the testing data. Here’s a detailed analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training Metrics (Perfect 1.0 scores):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accuracy (0.91)**: The model correctly classifies **91.4%** of the training data. This indicates that the model has learned the patterns in the training data well, but there is room for improvement, especially in recall.\n",
    "- **Precision (0.96)**: The model is highly precise on the training data, correctly identifying **96.4%** of the patients predicted to have breast cancer as actual positives. This means the model is making very few false positive predictions.\n",
    "- **Recall (0.80)**: The recall of **79.9%** indicates that the model is correctly identifying **80%** of the actual positive cases (patients with breast cancer). However, it is missing about **20%** of the true positive cases (false negatives), which is a concern for a health-related classification task.\n",
    "- **F1 Score (0.87)**: The F1 score, which balances precision and recall, is **87.4%**, indicating solid performance. However, it also highlights that recall is pulling down the overall score compared to the very high precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing Metrics (Near-perfect but slightly lower):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accuracy (0.95)**: The model correctly classifies **94.7%** of the testing data, a strong performance and an improvement over the training accuracy. This suggests the model generalizes well to unseen data.\n",
    "- **Precision (1.0)**: Precision is perfect (**100%**) on the test data, meaning that all patients the model predicts as having breast cancer actually have the disease. There are zero false positives, which is excellent in medical diagnostics, where false positives can lead to unnecessary anxiety and additional tests.\n",
    "- **Recall (0.86)**: The recall on the test set is **86%**, meaning the model correctly identifies **86%** of the actual positive cases. While this is an improvement over the training recall (**79.9%**), there is still room to increase recall so that fewer cases of actual breast cancer are missed.\n",
    "- **F1 Score (0.92)**: The F1 score on the test data is **92.5%**, reflecting a well-balanced model that handles both precision and recall well.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis of Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Precision, Lower Recall:** Both in the training and testing results, precision is significantly higher than recall. This indicates that while the model is very good at making correct positive predictions (few false positives), it is still missing a proportion of actual positive cases (some false negatives). In the context of breast cancer detection, high precision is critical because false positives can lead to unnecessary medical interventions. However, recall is equally important because failing to detect actual cases of breast cancer (false negatives) can have serious consequences.\n",
    "- **Generalization:** The model’s testing performance is strong and even slightly better than the training performance. This suggests that the model generalizes well and is not overfitting. The improvement in testing accuracy (**0.95 vs. 0.91**) and recall (**0.86 vs. 0.80**) is somewhat unusual but can happen when the test set is simpler or more representative of the general population than the training set.\n",
    "- **F1 Score Balance:** The F1 score, which balances precision and recall, is quite high in both training (**0.87**) and testing (**0.92**). The improvement in the test F1 score suggests that the model's trade-off between precision and recall is more favorable when generalized to unseen data.\n",
    "- **Room for Recall Improvement:** Although the model performs well overall, the relatively lower recall, especially on the training data (**0.80**), indicates that there are still some missed cases of breast cancer (false negatives). Given the context of breast cancer classification, improving recall would likely be a priority.\n"

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "After hyperparameter tuning, the SVM classifier for Breast Cancer classification shows significant improvements across both training and testing metrics. Let's discuss the metrics,\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training Metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accuracy (0.97)**: The model correctly classifies **97.1%** of the training data, indicating a strong fit to the training set.\n",
    "- **Precision (0.98)**: Precision is very high, meaning almost all predictions labeled as positive (patients with breast cancer) are correct. The model rarely makes false positive predictions.\n",
    "- **Recall (0.94)**: Recall has improved significantly compared to the default configuration, indicating that the model is now correctly identifying **94%** of actual positive cases (patients with breast cancer), which is crucial for minimizing false negatives.\n",
    "- **F1 Score (0.96)**: The F1 score, a balance between precision and recall, is very high, reflecting the model's strong overall performance in identifying positive cases with few false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing Metrics (Improved performance):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accuracy (0.96)**: The model achieves **95.6%** accuracy on the test data, which is a very strong result and shows good generalization to unseen data.\n",
    "- **Precision (0.98)**: Similar to the training set, the precision on the test set is very high, meaning the model is making highly reliable positive predictions with almost no false positives.\n",
    "- **Recall (0.91)**: The recall on the test set is **90.7%**, showing that the model identifies most of the actual positive cases in the test set, though a small percentage of cases may still go undetected (false negatives).\n",
    "**F1 Score (0.94)**: The F1 score on the test set is **0.94**, indicating that the model performs well in balancing precision and recall, even on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improved Recall:** Compared to the previous results, recall has improved on both the training and testing datasets **(from 0.80 to 0.94 in training and from 0.86 to 0.91 in testing)**. This means the model is now identifying a higher proportion of true positives, which is essential in breast cancer detection. Fewer cases are being missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generalization to Unseen Data:** The testing performance closely mirrors the training performance, with only a slight drop in recall **(0.94 to 0.91)** and F1 score **(0.96 to 0.94)**. This suggests that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data, avoiding overfitting and maintaining high predictive power."
